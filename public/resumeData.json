    "bio": "Hi there, I'm Xavier! \n\n A driven Full-Stack Developer and a former social worker, leveraging my unique background to bring robust problem-solving skills and empathy into the tech space. Proficient in JavaScript (ES6), HTML5, CSS, SASS, MERN stack, and Vue.js. A quick learner and a proactive team player, I recently navigated a high-rated real-case Vue.js project after a short span of learning.\n\n Moved from Macau to the Netherlands seeking adventure and career progression, I am excited to contribute my skills and resilience to the vibrant Dutch tech industry. As an EU citizen, I am ready to embark on this journey without a work visa requirement. \n\nWith an adventurous spirit and a thirst for learning, I've transitioned from social work to tech, adapting swiftly to the Dutch culture and tech industry. Now, as my family is settled, I am eager to contribute to the tech space. If you have any opportunities or advice, don't hesitate to reach out at xavierchanglaiin@gmail.com.",
